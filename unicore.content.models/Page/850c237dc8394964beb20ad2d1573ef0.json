Andressa\u2019s story reflects the challenges faced by many of the girls we spoke to...*\r\n\r\nLike many of the girls who contributed to the Girl Declaration, 16-year-old Andressa from Brazil talked about the risks of violence she faces as a girl. \"Assaults, shootings,\" she says. \"I won't lie that a lot of things happen here.\"\r\n\r\nThat's why goal 3 of the Declaration is about ensuring girls\u2019 safety, so they can live free from the fear of violence and harassment. Andressa also talks about her determination to get an education so she can create a better life for herself and her family. That determination was echoed by all the girls consulted, which is why goal 2 of the Declaration focuses on improving girls' access to schools and the quality of education they receive.\r\n \r\nGirls can't succeed when they live in fear. From creating safe spaces to passing stronger laws, ending violence against girls is the first step to ending global poverty. \r\n\r\nRead the Girl Declaration in full. \r\n",
