Take note of the journeys they have been on and the choices they have made. Find a training program or girls\u2019 club that can help you learn budgeting, saving, and money management. These skills go a long way in life. Don\u2019t be scared to make mistakes along the way. Learn from them instead. They will make you stronger. Believe in your goals and stay motivated. Accept that there may be hard times. But know that you can achieve great things in life!",
