Practice in front of a mirror or with a trusted friend.\r\n\r\nAvoid it. Try to avoid spending time with people who make you uncomfortable or try to get you to do things you don\u2019t want to. \r\n\r\nSay it out loud. If someone\u2019s trying to get you to do something you know you shouldn\u2019t, or something that makes you feel nervous say NO out loud.  Or you can say, \u201cNo thanks. I don\u2019t do that.\u2019 \r\n\r\nDo the smart thing:  Ask yourself what could the consequences be? What could go wrong? What will your friends or family think if you make this choice? \r\n\r\nPrevent a pregnancy. If you want to avoid getting pregnant when you have sex you will need to use a contraceptive like a condom, the pill or a contraceptive injection. Some contraceptives may be provided for free by the government, clinic or other organizations. Explore around your place to find out where can you get them. Condoms are always the best choice. They can prevent pregnancy and also protect you from any diseases you can catch through having sex. \r\n",
