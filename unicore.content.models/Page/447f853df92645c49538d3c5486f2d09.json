But this isn\u2019t always practiced at home. \r\nYou have the right to be treated with respect and to be safe and secure in your home. If this isn\u2019t the case then speak to someone you trust like a teacher or village leader. A problem shared can be a burden lifted.  \r\nIf someone older tries to scare you by shouting at you or hurting you, it can be can be abuse and is wrong. Find an adult you trust to help you.\r\nThere is nothing more traumatic for a child than losing a parent \u2013 never mind both. Growing up without parents or a caring adult looking after you can mean you are more at risk of harm. But you still have the right to education and healthcare. \r\n",
