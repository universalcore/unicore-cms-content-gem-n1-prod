If the egg is not fertilized that month, this thick lining breaks down and come out over a few days \u2014that\u2019s your period. \r\nOnce you start menstruation your body is able become pregnant and have a baby if you have sex. You must make sure you protect yourself from getting pregnant if you are not ready to have a baby.\r\nIt is normal to have some cramps in the stomach during menstruation. It helps to place a warm water bag on your stomach. It is better to do light exercise like walking around than to stay in one place. If the pain is too much, please consult a doctor. \r\nIf sanitary napkins are not available and you use a cloth, make sure that the cloth is soft, cleaned and dried properly. \r\nWhen you do not get your period, your body is sending you a message, so pay attention. Try to eat healthy foods and get lots of sleep. If you don\u2019t get your period for a few months, you should go see a nurse or a doctor\r\n",
