  "content": "*The drug trade and an ongoing conflict make certain neighbourhoods - or barrios - in the city of Bogota, Columbia very dangerous, especially for young girls. This is one girl\u2019s story.* \r\n\r\nMy name is Leidy, and I\u2019m a 17-year-old Colombian girl. I had a rough start in life. My mother left when I was a baby. I wouldn\u2019t even know her if I passed her on the street. \r\n\r\nMy dad is in and out of the house, and my life. Once he hit my hand with a hammer to punish me for stealing. After that, I was blamed whenever things went missing at home. I started spending a lot more time outside my house just to get away.\r\n\r\nSchool was never easy for me. I was teased for being chubby. All the bullying from my classmates really took its toll. I started skipping school every other day. Eventually I stopped going altogether. When I felt that tight dark loneliness creep over me, I\u2019d go to a viewpoint and look out at all the poor people there struggling just like me. It made me feel better. I wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. \r\n\r\nOne day I bumped into a group of young people who didn\u2019t like school either. They invited me to hang out. I was drawn to them because they made me feel like I was one of them. \r\n\r\nBefore long I was drinking and smoking with them. When my dad found out that I had tried marijuana, he flew into a rage and beat me. He beat me so badly that I left. My grandmother reported me as a runaway. I was picked up by the authorities and placed in a correctional home for teenagers.\r\n\r\nAt first, it was a place of sadness. I thought about escaping. \r\n\r\nBut that was when my life began to turn around.\r\n\r\nAt the home I met a man who played the piano. He was from an organisation called Ayara that helped girls like me \u2013 girls who were looking for somewhere to fit in and be accepted. \r\n\r\nThe organisation taught me how to express myself through rap music and dance. The first time I performed for the group I was embarrassed. I thought everyone was going to laugh at me. Instead, they whistled and clapped!\r\n\r\nSinging flows through my veins, but I discovered that dancing cheers me up. When I\u2019m dancing, I forget all the problems and pressures in my life. \r\n\r\nThere are still bumps in my journey, but I\u2019m determined. Instead of running away from my problems, now I come to Ayara and dance when the stress of life pushes me down. I still want to someday earn a living as an artist and I am breakdancing every chance I get. I work hard and rely on my people to make it happen. \r\n\r\nRead more about Leidy\u2019s story on grassrootsgirls.tumblr.com\r\n",
